          <p>1) The FAO (food and agricultural organisation) in 2017 estimated that 190.7 million people are undernourished in India; they don’t receive even one time food.

           <br>   2) According to the estimates by the UN, approximately 40 percent of food prepared in India is wasted and this accounts to one lakh crore rupees loss every year.
            
           <br> 3) Hotels, restaurants, weddings, events and festivals in India largely contribute to food wastage.

           <br>  4) The initial stage of food production happens in preliminary stage i.e. during agriculture, due to storms, rainfall etc, from factors that influence the growth of crops.
          
         <br> 5) When the food is stored, then wastage also occurs due to pests and other microorganisms. </p>
